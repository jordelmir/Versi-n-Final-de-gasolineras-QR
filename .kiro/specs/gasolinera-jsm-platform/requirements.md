# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gasolinera JSM Digital Coupon Platform is a comprehensive gamified microservices ecosystem that enables gas station customers to scan coupons, view advertisements to multiply raffle tickets, and participate in promotional activities. The platform consists of multiple microservices including authentication, station management, coupon processing, redemption handling, advertisement engine, raffle system, and a unified API gateway. The system must be fully containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for seamless deployment and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a gas station customer, I want to register and authenticate in the platform, so that I can access personalized coupon and raffle features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user provides valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a user account with encrypted credentials
2. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT token for authenticated access
3. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and authorize access
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage gas stations and their employees, so that I can control which locations participate in the coupon program.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a new station THEN the system SHALL store station details including location, contact information, and operational status
2. WHEN an administrator assigns employees to a station THEN the system SHALL create employee records with appropriate roles and permissions
3. WHEN station information is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails of changes
4. WHEN querying stations THEN the system SHALL return active stations with their current employee assignments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to scan and validate coupons at gas stations, so that I can receive discounts and earn raffle tickets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer scans a valid coupon QR code THEN the system SHALL validate the coupon and mark it as used
2. WHEN a coupon is validated THEN the system SHALL generate the appropriate number of raffle tickets for the customer
3. IF a coupon has already been used THEN the system SHALL reject the validation attempt with an appropriate message
4. WHEN coupon validation occurs THEN the system SHALL record the transaction with timestamp, station, and customer details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view advertisements to multiply my raffle tickets, so that I can increase my chances of winning prizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer requests to view ads THEN the system SHALL serve relevant advertisements based on available campaigns
2. WHEN a customer completes viewing an advertisement THEN the system SHALL multiply their raffle tickets according to the ad campaign rules
3. WHEN ad engagement is recorded THEN the system SHALL track metrics for advertiser analytics
4. IF no advertisements are available THEN the system SHALL inform the customer appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to participate in raffles and see my ticket count, so that I can track my chances of winning prizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer earns raffle tickets THEN the system SHALL update their ticket balance in real-time
2. WHEN a raffle drawing occurs THEN the system SHALL randomly select winners based on ticket distribution
3. WHEN raffle results are determined THEN the system SHALL notify winners and update prize statuses
4. WHEN customers query their raffle status THEN the system SHALL display current ticket count and participation history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all services to communicate through a unified API gateway, so that I can manage security, routing, and monitoring centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external requests are made THEN the API gateway SHALL route them to appropriate microservices
2. WHEN requests require authentication THEN the gateway SHALL validate JWT tokens before forwarding requests
3. WHEN service communication occurs THEN the gateway SHALL implement rate limiting and request logging
4. IF a microservice is unavailable THEN the gateway SHALL return appropriate error responses and implement circuit breaker patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the entire system to be containerized and orchestrated, so that I can deploy and scale services efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the platform THEN all microservices SHALL be containerized with Docker
2. WHEN starting the system THEN Docker Compose SHALL orchestrate all services including databases and caches
3. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL automatically connect to PostgreSQL and Redis instances
4. WHEN the system is running THEN all services SHALL be accessible through the API gateway on a single port

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any service THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with correlation IDs
2. WHEN database connections fail THEN services SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN inter-service communication fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality where possible
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN health check endpoints SHALL provide service status information
